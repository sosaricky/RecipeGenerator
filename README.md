# Rails Template for Learning Camp

## How to use

1. Clone this repo
1. Install PostgreSQL in case you don't have it
1. Install node and yarn. Expected node version ">=16 || 14 >=14.17".
1. Run `yarn install` and `yarn build --watch`. This bundles the JS assets in the administration site using [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild).
1. `bundle exec rspec` and make sure all tests pass (non-headless mode) or `HEADLESS=true bundle exec rspec` (headless mode)
1. `rails assets:precompile` to precompile assets
1. Run `bin/dev`.
1. You can now try your REST services!

## Dev scripts

This template provides a handful of scripts to make your dev experience better!

- bin/bundle to run any `bundle` commands.
  - `bin/bundle install`
- bin/rails to run any `rails` commands
  - `bin/rails console`
- bin/web to run any `bash` commands
  - `bin/web ls`
- bin/rspec to run specs
  - `bin/rspec .`
- bin/dev to run both Rails and JS build processes at the same time in a single terminal tab.
  - `bin/dev`

You don't have to use these but they are designed to run the same when running with Docker or not.
To illustrate, `bin/rails console` will run the console in the docker container when running with docker and locally when not.
